## About Me

I am a computer science and mathematics student at Emory University in the BS/MS program. My interests sit at the intersection of human–computer interaction, artificial intelligence, game development, and data science.

I have worked on applied AI projects in Emory’s AI Data Lab, completed a backend engineering internship in fintech, and served as coordinator and coach for Emory’s League of Legends varsity team. Most of my work involves building systems—ranging from machine learning pipelines to SDL3-based game engines and experimental HCI prototypes.
